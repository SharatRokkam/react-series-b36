useReducer Hook : --------------------------------------------------
useReducer hook is similar to useState, but instead of providing state and setter function. It provides state and dispatch function
It accepts two arguments :
1. reducer function 2. initial state

and returns the "current state" and "dispatch method"...

Difference and UseCase : -----------------------------------------

'useState' is best suited for simple state updates, such as toggling a boolean value, updating a single input field, or managing simple counters.

'useReducer' is more appropriate for more complex state management scenarios, such as managing form inputs, handling complex state transitions, or when the state logic involves multiple related values.
