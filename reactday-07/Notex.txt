In React, controlled and uncontrolled components refer to how form elements (like inputs, selects, textareas) are managed and updated.

Controlled Components
Definition: In a controlled component, form data is handled by the component’s state. The React component that renders the form elements controls what their values are, typically using useState.

Characteristics:

1. Form element's value is tied to the state.
2. Updates to the form element’s value trigger state updates.
3. Easy to enforce validation and other logic based on the form input values.

Uncontrolled Components
Definition: In an uncontrolled component, form data is handled by the DOM itself. React does not control the input value; instead, you use references (refs) to access the form values.

Characteristics:

1.Form element's value is managed by the DOM.
2.You access the value using refs when needed (e.g., on form submission).
3.Useful for quick forms where you don’t need to monitor the input value until form submission.

useRef Hook
useRef is a versatile hook that provides a way to manage references and mutable values in functional components, offering more control over DOM interactions and component behavior.

useRef is a hook that provides a way to directly access and interact with DOM elements, as well as to persist mutable values across renders without causing a re-render. It is part of the React Hooks API and is used for various purposes, including:

Accessing DOM elements:
1.useRef can create a reference to a DOM element, allowing you to directly interact with it.
2.Persisting values between renders:
useRef can store a value that persists across renders without triggering a re-render when updated.
