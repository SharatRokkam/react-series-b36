//Components : code that can be created and reused multiple time in a project, we can use multiple chunks of components to create a whole web page 

There are two types of Components :
1. Functional Component
2.  Class Component

Class Component in React is one of the ways to define components that have their own state and lifecycle methods.
But Functional Component with hooks are more commonly used in Modern React development. 

// Props(Properties) and State 
Props(immutable) are read only inputs to a react component that are passed down from parent to child component, Props can be any type of data: string, number, objects, arrays and function....

State are built in object used to manage data that changes over time with a component. State is local to the component it is defined, can modified using useState hook in function component, in class we setState....
