1. Suppose you have a number 121 you have to check if it is palindrome or not..
madam -> madam, anna - anna, kick - kcik


2. const array1 = ['tomato', 'potato', 'ginger']
add 'cabbage' to the first index and 'brinjal' to the last of the array...

3. const student = {
    name : 'Mahesh Babu',
    age : 48,
    isActor : true, 
}

you have to add a property for 'industry : tollywood', to this object...
